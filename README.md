# GridKid-Spreadsheet-App
GridKid is a spreadsheet application that is designed to run in the terminal. I started working on it as part of my CS 430 class at JMU (Programming Languages) with Dr. Chris Johnson and am using Ruby to implement it. It's designed to present a table of cells that the user can fill with data and/or formulae to perform computational tasks, as you would with a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel, for example. The project is broken down into four separate milestones: Model of the Spreadsheet, an Interpreter, an Interface, and Variables and Control Flow.
